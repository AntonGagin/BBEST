Title: Bayesian Estimation of Incoherent Neutron Scattering Backgrounds
Description: In the package BBEST (Bayesian Background ESTimation) we implemented 
        a Bayesian-statistics approach for subtraction of incoherent scattering 
        from neutron total-scattering data. In this approach, the estimated 
        background signal associated with incoherent scattering maximizes the 
        posterior probability, which combines the likelihood of this signal in 
        reciprocal and real spaces with the prior that favors smooth lines.
